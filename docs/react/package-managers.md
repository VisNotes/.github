### npm (Node Package Manager)
**Primary Use:** Managing node packages.

- **Installing Packages**: `npm install <package>` will add a package to your `node_modules` directory.
- **Versioning**: Packages can be installed with specific versions. For example, `npm install <package>@<version>`.
- **Configuration**: Uses `package.json` to manage project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
- **Scripts**: You can define scripts in `package.json` and run them with `npm run <script>`.
- **Global vs. Local**: Packages can be installed globally (`npm install -g <package>`) or locally (`npm install <package>`).

### yarn
**Primary Use:** Managing node packages with a focus on speed, reliability, and determinism.

- **Installation Speed**: Generally faster than npm due to better caching mechanisms and parallel downloads.
- **Lock File**: Uses `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent installations across various environments.
- **Aliases**: Similar commands to `npm`, but with slightly different syntax. For example, `yarn add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`.
- **Offline Mode**: Can install dependencies even when offline if they have been previously installed.
- **Workspaces**: Supports managing multiple packages within a single repository (monorepos).

### npx
**Primary Use:** Running node packages without globally installing them.

- **Execute Packages**: Allows you to run packages as commands without requiring a global install. For example, `npx create-react-app my-app` runs the `create-react-app` package without installing it globally.
- **Default with npm**: Comes bundled with `npm` version 5.2.0 and above.
- **Temporary Installation**: Installs packages temporarily and removes them after execution.
- **Ease of Use**: Particularly useful for running one-off commands, starting scripts, or initializing projects.

### pnpm
**Primary Use:** Managing node packages with efficient handling of disk space.

- **Efficient Disk Usage**: Uses a unique symlink structure to save disk space and speed up installations.
- **Performance**: Often faster than `npm` and `yarn` due to its optimized package management.
- **Lock File**: Uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` for consistent installations across various environments.
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with the npm ecosystem and supports npm scripts.
- **Workspaces**: Also supports monorepo management similar to `yarn workspaces`.

### When to Use Them

- **npm**: Use for general package management tasks. It's the default and most widely supported.
- **yarn**: Use when you need faster installations, better offline support, or when working with monorepos.
- **npx**: Use when you want to run packages without installing them globally, such as for one-off commands or initializing new projects.
- **pnpm**: Use when efficient disk usage and fast installations are priorities, along with full compatibility with the npm ecosystem and support for monorepos.
